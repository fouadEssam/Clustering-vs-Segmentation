# Clustering vs. Segmentation: A Business Perspective üè¶üí°

This repository demonstrates the key differences between **clustering** and **segmentation**, focusing on their applications in business, particularly for loan data analysis.

---

## **Introduction**
In business, understanding customer behavior is key to driving growth. Two powerful tools that often work together are:
- **Clustering**: Groups customers based on data patterns.
- **Segmentation**: Refines these groups using business rules and logic to align with strategic goals.

---

## **Clustering: The Data-Driven Step**
- Clustering groups customers based on similarities, revealing hidden patterns.
- Example: Using K-Means to group loan customers based on loan size, period, and interest rate.

### **Code Example**
The `clustering.py` script demonstrates:
1. Preprocessing loan data.
2. Applying K-Means clustering.
3. Visualizing the results.

## **Segmentation: The Business Strategy Tool**
- Segmentation applies business logic to refine clusters into actionable groups.
- Example: Using RFM analysis to categorize customers into high-value, engaged, or at-risk segments.

### **Code Example**
The `segmentation.py` script demonstrates:
1. Creating RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
2. Defining business rules to classify customers.
3. Saving the results for actionable insights.

## **Why It Matters**
By combining clustering and segmentation, businesses can:
- Build loyalty programs for reliable customers.
- Re-engage at-risk customers with targeted strategies.
- Align data insights with business goals to boost profitability.
